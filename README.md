Version 1.0.0

This is an Android app which displays movie info from The MovieDB (www.themoviedb.org)

---

## Usage Notes:

Because this app pulls from The MovieDB API, an API key is required.
In the app, this key is stored in constant variable VALUE_API_KEY, found at the top of the NetworkUtils.java class file.
To use this app successfully, you will need to procure your own API key from The MovieDB and modify the NetworkUtils.java file to add your personal key to the VALUE_API_KEY variable.
